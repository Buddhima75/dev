ROBOT IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

IMPORTANT: The website is currently displaying an SVG robot as a fallback. To use your own custom AI robot image:

1. Add a file named "robot.png" to this directory (same location as this instructions file)
2. The image should have a transparent background for best results
3. Recommended size: approximately 500px tall
4. The image should be of a modern AI robot or humanoid character
5. For best visual effect, choose an image with blue/cool tones to match the site's color scheme

You can find suitable AI robot images on sites like:
- Vecteezy (search for "AI robot PNG transparent background")
- Pngitem
- FreePNGimg
- Or any stock photo site with transparent PNG images

Once you add a proper robot.png file to this directory, the website will automatically use it instead of the basic SVG robot currently displaying. You do not need to modify any code - simply add the image file with the correct name.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you've added robot.png but still don't see your image:
1. Make sure it's named exactly "robot.png" (case-sensitive)
2. Try clearing your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Verify the image file is valid and not corrupted
4. Check file permissions to ensure the web server can read the file

Note: Currently, the website includes a text file named "robot.png" that serves as a placeholder. 
You need to REPLACE this with an actual PNG image file.
